# mac-battery-count-tracker
How does the battery count work? This project attempts to seek an answer to this question.

## Background
One of the things that become imperative to care for when you get your new Macbook is the battery life. However, it can be so confusing and frustrating when you make some findings to know how to prolong the life of your battery. The blogs don't come to the rescue, neither do the YouTube videos! It all becomes overwhelming with time that the only alternative is to go by your insinct. While insincts can be to ones advantage, it also poses some threat to the battery life of your system.
This aim of this work is to investigate best practices to prolong a Macbook laptop.
I must need say that this experiment is being carried out on a Macbook M1 Pro. However, I feel the code should work on any other Macbook.

Recall that feeling when you got your first Macbook?
